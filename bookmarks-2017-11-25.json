Including numerous examples, figures, and exercises, this book is suited for students, lecturers, and researchers working in audio engineering, computer science, multimedia, and musicology.The book consists of eight chapters. The first two cover foundations of music representations and the Fourier transform—concepts that are then used throughout the book. In the subsequent chapters, concrete music processing tasks serve as a starting point. Each of these chapters is organized in a similar fashion and starts with a general description of the music processing scenario at hand before integrating it into a wider context. It then discusses—in a mathematically rigorous way—important techniques and algorithms that are generally applicable to a wide range of analysis, classification, and retrieval problems. At the same time, the techniques are directly applied to a specific music processing task. By mixing theory and practice, the book’s goal is to offer detailed technological insights as well as a deep understanding of music processing applications. Each chapter ends with a section that includes links to the research literature, suggestions for further reading, a list of references, and exercises. The chapters are organized in a modular fashion, thus offering lecturers and readers many ways to choose, rearrange or supplement the material. Accordingly, selected chapters or individual sections can easily be integrated into courses on general multimedia, information science, signal processing, music informatics, or the digital humanities."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=HCI_CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=polyphonic+music+in+sharpeye&source=bl&ots=VoUiKks6cR&sig=UVyTM5pZKxXV0SowXoD3dP8rKEY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-1rrq9c_XAhUBzbwKHSzBDUwQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&q=polyphonic%20music%20in%20sharpeye&f=false"},{"guid":"fkSWzOr6d6k3","title":"Intelligent Information and Database Systems: 4th Asian Conference, ACIIDS ... - Google Books","index":5,"dateAdded":1511334905863000,"lastModified":1511334911461000,"id":104,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"The three-volume set LNAI 7196, LNAI 7197 and LNAI 7198 constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 4th Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems, ACIIDS 2012, held in Kaohsiung, Taiwan in March 2012.
